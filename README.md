# P3M People

If you're a project, program or portfolio manager, a scrum master or an agile coach in a more traditional company, then this community is for you.

## Newsletter
Sign up for the weekly(ish) newsletter here: [https://p3mpeople.substack.com/](https://p3mpeople.substack.com/). You get to be party to my ramblings, musing and opinions about the state of the industry and the field of project, program and portfolio management, agile and lean.

You’ll join the Slack group automatically on signing up for the newsletter - if you’d rather not join the group, just let me know. 

## Slack Community
A place for real-time (location dependent) chat about all things project, program or portfolio management, agile or otherwise! The slack group will offer you the opportunity to talk with like minded people, learn new skills and tools, seek help for any problems you might be having or mentor those that are just beginning their careers.
